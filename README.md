## Overview

This is a dynamic web page using GIPHY API to populate with gifs of animals. it uses GIPHY API, JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

## How It Works

Page creates some default buttons of animals name when is bieng loaded

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it  stops playing.

Under every gif,its rating is being displayed (PG, G, so on).

 User can add new animal button by entering their name into input box and adds it into topics buttons. Then uses the added button to grab 10 gif images related to that button.
